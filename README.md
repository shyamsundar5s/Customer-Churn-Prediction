# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources to predict which customers are likely to leave a business using data science and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project demonstrates how to use Python, data analysis, and machine learning to analyze customer data and predict churn.

## Features

- Data exploration and visualization
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning model building and evaluation
- Insights into important factors affecting customer churn

## Dataset

The primary dataset used in this project is `Churn_Modelling.csv`, which includes information for 10,000 customers with the following features:

- `CreditScore`
- `Geography`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Tenure`
- `Balance`
- `NumOfProducts`
- `HasCrCard`
- `IsActiveMember`
- `EstimatedSalary`
- `Exited` (Target variable: 1 if the customer left, 0 otherwise)
